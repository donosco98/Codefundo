### * - There are multiple issues with the current election system due to the primitive method of casting and counting votes being active. Given the advent of cryptocurrencies based on blockchain technology, this ideology has gained immense acceleration in application in different fields. We propose a solution for resolving a huge array of issues faced in the current voting system with the help of the blockchain technology.*

## ISSUES WE SEEK TO RESOLVE
1. **SECURITY**:- ***Elections are unfortunately prone to rigging which leads to unfair results. 
Rigging in election can be done in multiple ways:-***
	1. 	 Anyone can cast a vote in your name.
	2. .Fake and duplicate voter I.Ds are being used frequently.
	3. 	Anyone can tamper with votes that have been cast.
	4. There can be both malpractice and human error in counting votes.

**2. *Time and Resources:- Setting up booths with security and human resources to manage the election is cumbersome and expensive. Counting the votes takes up a lot of effort and is delayed which can cause errors in the result***.

**3. *Fake Data:- Politicians spend billions of dollars on propaganda. In addition to this, followers provide a lot of propaganda. All of this bombardment of news can lead to brainwashing and manipulation of data in forms of fake news.***

***4. People residing in different constituencies temporarily cannot vote.***
